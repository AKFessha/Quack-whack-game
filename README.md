# Quack-whack-game
This is a WebVR game built by A-frame and java script
By adjusting the camera to the box you hit the box with duck, which will produce a quack sound then thats you scoring one point.
This game can be played both on desktop and mobile,
The idea is inspired from a WebVR workshop by Andrezj in Barcelona
